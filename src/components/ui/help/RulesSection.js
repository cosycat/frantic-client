                    The object of the game is to get rid of your cards as fast
                    as possible. If a player has discarded all his cards, the
                    remaining players count the points in their hand. When a
                    player reaches the agreed maximum score, the player with
                    the lowest score wins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the middle of your screen you find the deck (all unused, remaining cards)
                    and the discard pile right next to it.
                    <br/>
                    The card on top of the deck gets flipped over and laid beside
                    the deck, forming the discard pile. This card starts the game,
                    and is looked at as if it was played by the dealer of the cards.
                    The direction of the game is counter-clockwise.
                    <br/>
                    However, the players have the opportunity to not play a valid
                    card, but in return draw one from the deck instead (by clicking the deck).
                    It is possible to then play the drawn card â€“ or any other valid card
                    from the player's hand.

                    If this situation takes place during the execution of an Event,

                    round.
